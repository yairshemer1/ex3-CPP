Hi,
This is a test for part 2 of ex3 in cpp - the SpamDetector.
All you need to do is:
1. copy all files inside the directory files_of_test (after you extract it) and paste them into your project directory.
2. Open pycharm and drag the file testCppex3.py into pycharm.
3. run (it compiles your cpp and hpp files by itself).

You should see one line printed for each test, and passed or failed in it.

Good luck!
Matan.
